# Predicting the Risk of Heart Disease in a Person Based on their Biomedical Data
Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and by predicting the probability that a patient has heart disease, we can choose which patients to prioritize for further diagnostic testing. In this project, I am investigating the relationship between various aspects of a patient's biomedical data and the probability that they have heart disease using a random forest model. Through my model, I confirmed that patients that are older, male, have a lower maximum heart rate, and have ST depression, are more likely to have heart disease.
